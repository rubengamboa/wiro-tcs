IK 220 Linux Driver
===================



1. Contents
---------

The Linux driver is provided as tar.gz file and comprises the following files:

ik220.c		IK220 Linux driver C source code
ik220.h		IK220 Linux driver header file
ik220_if.h	IK220 Linux driver header file [IOCTL]
Pgm220.h	Firmware of the IK220 hardware

ik220.o		Compiled kernel module


ik220_lib.c	IK220 Functions library, source-code file
ik220_lib.h	IK220 Functions library, header file


ik220con	Console program to control EnDat units
IK220Con.c	Source code of the console program to control EnDat units
IK220Con.h	Header file of the console program to control EnDat units

ik220_read48	Console program to control 11 µApp units via READ48 
IK220_read48.c	Source code of the console program to control 11 µApp units via READ48 


compile.sh	Script for creating the kernel module and the program examples


Describe.txt	This file



2. Installation
---------------

The driver was created for the kernel version 2.4 and tested for Debian "unstable" (APR 05).

Log on as root and run "./compile.sh".
All module are compiled now. As a result you obtain the file "ik220.o".

Now load the driver into the kernel: "insmod ik220.o". 

When doing so observe the messages in the log:  "tail -f /var/log/messages"

Afterwards you need to load the driver into the Dev file system: "mknod /dev/ik220 c 61 0"
Now the driver is available to the system!

Start your console program: "./ik220_read48"
You will receive some status information on IK220 and the current count of the 0 axis.
